# Connecting to Salesforce Commerce Cloud 

## Multiple SFCC instances support  
Single AEM instance can connect to multiple SFCC instances. Each SFCC instance should have a unique identifier â€“ **instanceId**, that is used to match configurations for different parts of the Connector. **instanceId** is needed to configure replication to SFCC, content preview of AEM pages in Edit Mode and product import. 

In example below we have two sites hosted on AEM Author instance: **US SiteGenesis** and **EU SiteGenesis**. Each site is connected to its own Salesforce Commerce Cloud instance. 

## Demandware Client 
DemandwareClient is responsible for connecting to Salesforce Commerce Cloud. It provides HttpClient and different endpoints. DemandwareClient is an OSGI configuration factory. To configure a new connection to a SFCC instance add an OSGI config. Below is the example from cq-commerce-demandware-multi-sample-content package installation. 

## Demandware Access Token Provider 
This configuration factory that must be configured to enable connection between AEM and Salesforce Commerce Cloud.
